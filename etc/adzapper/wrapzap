# Wrapper to set environment variables then exec the real zapper.
# The reasons for this are twofold:
#	- for some reason squid doesn't preserve the original environment
#	  when you do a restart (or SIGHUP)
#	- to avoid having to hack the squid startup script (if you have
#	  a presupplied one, such as ships with some linux distributions)
#
# Install in the same directory you put the zapper (just for convenience) and
# hack the pathnames below to suit.
# Note that you can skip this script and run the zapper with no environment
# settings at all and it will work fine; the variables are all set here merely
# for completeness so that customisation is easy for you.
